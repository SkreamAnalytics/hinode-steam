      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the Railway&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;387 passengers were carried on four busy running days in February.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The guards van received replacement steel on its ends, as areas of&#xA;corrosion continue to be addressed before repainting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Additional areas of concrete were laid in the southwestern part of the workshop to bring the floor up to railhead level. Just a few sections remain to be done.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;New van ends New trolley, holding cement Raised concrete floor sections&#xA;Safety Innovations&#xA;The open wagon is being fitted with water tanks and a pump that can be used to&#xA;spray down dry areas of grass to reduce the risk of lineside fires. Four tanks will&#xA;be fitted, carrying around 800 litres of water in total.&#xA;To minimise the possibility of bags or little legs falling beneath carriage gates,&#xA;the tops of the wooden end platforms were extended out 5-10cm using a block of&#xA;wood (its edge painted white) and topped with non-slip metal. This is also&#xA;visible in the picture in the top-right corner of this page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
