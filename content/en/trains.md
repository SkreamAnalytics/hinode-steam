**Steam Locomotive B10**

{{< image src="/img/trains/b10.jpg" class="img-fluid w-50" wrapper="text-center" >}}

&nbsp;


B10 is a 0-4-0st steam locomotive built by Hudswell Clarke and Company in 1924 for Messrs Armstrong, Whitworth of Tauranga for the construction of the Waihi to Tauranga section of the North Island East Coast Main Trunk Railway.

In 1930, B10 was sold to Milburn Lime and Cement, just South of Dunedin. B10 worked there until 1967 when it was sold to Waitaki NZ's Pukeuri Freezing Works for $1500.

In 1989 Oamaru Steam and Rail swapped ex-NZR Dsa's 234 and 218 for B10.

B10 was Oamaru Steam and Rail's main motive power up until April 2007 when she was pulled from service for her 10 year overhaul.  B10 has since returned to service in December 2018.

B10 Current Status: Operational.

&nbsp;


Uc366 is a 4-6-0 steam engine of 1901 built by Sharp, Stewart and Company for the New Zealand Government Railways.

In 1936 this engine, along with dozens of others, was dumped over the foreshore by the Oamaru Railway Station as erosion protection.

In 2009 when the sea wall was being rebuilt, this and many other remains were recovered. Uc366 has been on display at Oamaru Steam and Rail since.

**Husky**

{{< image src="/img/trains/husky.jpg" class="img-fluid w-50" wrapper="text-center" >}}

&nbsp;


Huskies are a class of 15 diesel mechanical locomotives built in the late 1950s to early 1960s by Robert Stephenson & Hawthorns Ltd. Most served industrial lines in the UK, although one went to Egypt and a 5 foot 6in gauge loco went to India.

Ours was the only one exported in New Zealand, being RS&H # 7908, built in Darlington (Northeast England) for the Wellington Meat Export Co. in 1962. The September 2017 NZ Railfan magazine pictures the loco breaking down on her maiden voyage out to the Ngauranga Works before being rescued by an electric locomotive. In 1975 the loco was sold to Alliance, Pukeuri.

In 2009 the loco moved to Oamaru Steam and Rail. She has since had a gearbox and running gear overhaul, received air brakes and many other improvements.

In addition to ours, two locos have been saved in the UK: # 7901 built in 1958 is preserved and used occasionally on work trains at the Tanfield Railway near Newcastle, and prototype #7900 from 1958 was saved and plinthed by its last owner, AV Dawson transportation in Middlesbrough.

**Tr 35**

&nbsp;

Tr 35 was one of the third batch of 0-4-0 shunting tractors supplied by the Drewry Car Company in the UK. These small locomotives were typically assigned to smaller rural stations to shunt wagons around the yards as required and moved locations every few years depending on the ever-changing needs of the Railway.

Built in June 1939 at the English Electric (Dick Kerr) works in Preston and entering service in September of that year, she was originally powered by a Parsons petrol engine.

In 1978 she received the TMS number TR 223 and after being written off in February 1988, was purchased by Oamaru Steam and Rail. 

Tr 35 Current Status: Overhaul
