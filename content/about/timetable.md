The train departs from Harbourside Station at the corner of Humber and Itchen Streets in the historic Harbourside area of Oamaru, New Zealand. 

After leaving the station, you travel through the Historic Precinct, past some of Oamaru's oldest buildings and then through the old railway yard and past the site of Oamaru's first railway station. The train then runs along the bottom of clay cliffs, beside Oamaru's Victorian Harbour. 

At the end of the line our terminus is Quarry Siding next to the Red Sheds built in the 1800s.

The return trip is approximately half an hour, including 15 minutes up to the the world famous Oamaru Blue Penguin Colony where NZ fur seals can often be seen up close lying on the rocks.

If 15 minutes isn't long enough for you to enjoy the area, you can catch a later train back to Harbourside Station.
